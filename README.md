## Predictive Power of Distance Metrics for Cancer Patient Survival

### Overview

This project explored the predictive potential of distance metrics applied to mutation trees in cancer genomics. By analyzing the evolutionary pathways of tumors, we investigated whether these metrics—individually or in combination—can improve prognostic predictions beyond traditional genotype and clinical data.

### Motivation

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and genetic mutations, leading to intra-tumor heterogeneity that complicates treatment responses. Conventional therapies often target dominant cancer subclones, but post-remission phases may give rise to resistant subclones, challenging treatment efficacy. Mutation trees, representing the evolutionary relationships among tumor subclones, provide critical insights into drug resistance and disease progression. The application of distance metrics to analyze mutation trees has gained interest for its potential to reveal hidden patterns in tumor evolution. However, no standard metric adequately captures the complexity of all cancer types, motivating our research into optimizing metric combinations for improved survival prediction.

### Objectives

This study assesses the ability of distance metrics to predict patient survival in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Breast Cancer. The primary goal was to determine whether these metrics—alone or combined—enhance prognostic predictions and validate their association with clinical outcomes. Using real-world datasets, we optimized metric combinations through survival data analysis, comparing stratification models based on tree-derived information with those relying solely on genotype and clinical data. The findings aimed to contribute to advancing individualized cancer treatment strategies.

### Presentations

The work was presented at multiple venues, including:

- A group meeting at ETH-DBSSE within the computational biology group;

- The OLISSIPO annual meeting, with a seminar at EMBL in Heidelberg.
